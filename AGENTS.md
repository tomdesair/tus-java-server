# Agent Instructions

## GitHub CLI (`gh`) Usage
When running `gh` commands in this project via an automated agent environment, ensure you bypass the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. The agent environment may have an invalid `GITHUB_TOKEN` set, which `gh` prioritizes over valid keyring credentials, resulting in an `HTTP 401: Bad credentials` error.

**Workaround:** Prefix `gh` commands with `env -u GITHUB_TOKEN` to force the CLI to use the valid keyring authentication.

Example:
```bash
env -u GITHUB_TOKEN gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."
```

## Release Process
When performing a release, please strictly follow the instructions outlined in the [docs/RELEASE.md](docs/RELEASE.md) documentation file.
