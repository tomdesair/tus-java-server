## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **File Deduplication by Hash**: Implemented optional, space-saving duplicate file detection and linking based on file checksums.
  - Added `withUploadDeduplication(boolean)` builder method on `TusFileUploadService` (default: `false` for backward compatibility).
  - Introduced index system under `<storagePath>/checksums/<algorithm>/<checksum_value>` for mapping file checksums to their original completed upload IDs.
  - Implemented safe read-only recursion in `DiskStorageService` for child uploads: read operations (`getUploadedBytes`, `copyUploadTo`) recursively resolve to the parent upload, while write/truncate operations (`append`, `removeLastNumberOfBytes`) remain strictly bounded to the child ID to avoid accidental parent modifications.
  - Added parent-child expiration coordination: parent upload's expiration timestamp is automatically updated to be greater than or equal to any linked child upload's expiration.
  - Self-cleaning index system: dangling index entries resulting from parent deletion/expiration are automatically detected and removed on the fly.
  - Added new `duplicatesUploadId`, `checksum`, and `checksumAlgorithm` fields to `UploadInfo`.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Explicitly declared `serialVersionUID = -8751200491586638308L` inside `UploadInfo` to prevent serialization version mismatches for pre-existing upload data on disk.
- **Deduplication of Parsing Logic**: Introduced `Utils.ChecksumInfo` and `Utils.parseUploadChecksumHeader` to completely centralize header validation and parsing.
